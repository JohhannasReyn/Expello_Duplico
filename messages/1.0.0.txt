Expelloduplico 1.0.0
--------------------

This is a simple plugin for Sublime Text that adds the ability to quickly select (by default) 
or remove (optional) all redundant entries in a document, or in the user's selected text.

It will attempt to differentiate entries if there are delimiters in place, otherwise it will
base the selections off of each individual word.

This is the second plugin I've made for Sublime Text.
The first being 'Lensort' which sorts lines of a selection
or document by their length purely for asthetics.
