Expelloduplico
--------------

This package adds a feature to Sublime Text that selects or removes 
duplicate entries in a text document or a delimited file.

Usage Options
---

  - Right click, or select from the 'Edit' menu, "Select or Remove Duplicates"
    by default the plugin will "Select" all duplicate entries in the file, or 
    in the currently selected body of text.

    Alternatively, if you choose to implement the suggested key bindings...
    (which can be viewed/enabled from `Deault (<your OS>).sublime-keymap`)
    ...then to utilize this feature simply press "Ctrl+Shift+U" (U - 'Unique')
    or whichever key combination you specify.

  - In the plugin settings, there are the following options:

      * delimiters: this is a list of delimiters the plugin will attempt, 
        in the order they appear, as a qualifying delimiter is determined.
        
        Note: the last delimiter is a space, this is a catch all, should 
        the other potential delimiters not qualify, this one will almost 
        always qualify and compares each individual word within the file.

      * threshold: this is the minimum number of occurrances required to
        qualify as a delimiter. This is used to ensure the appropriate 
        delimiter is used for the targeted text.

      * do_with_duplicates_found: there are two options for this variable,
        'selecto' or 'expello', selecto selects the entries found, whereas
        expello removes the entries found without any verification.

  - I hope this plugin serves you well, if you have any issues using it,
